## 🚀 Getting Started

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd cdacs/church-system

# Install dependencies
composer install

cp .env.example .env

# Generate keys
php artisan key:generate
php artisan jwt:secret

# Run migrations and seed
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

# Start server
php artisan serve
```

**Backend will run on:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd cdacs/frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
quasar dev
```

**Frontend will run on:** `http://localhost:9000`

## 📋 Testing the Application

### 1. Using Postman

Import `church-system/postman_collection.json` into Postman

**Test Flow:**
1. Register a new user → JWT token auto-saved
2. Login with credentials → Token refreshed
3. Test protected endpoints (announcements, events, etc.)
4. Create ministries, record contributions

### 2. Using Frontend

1. Open browser: `http://localhost:9000`
2. You'll see the login page
3. Register a new account or login with existing credentials
4. Access role-based dashboard
5. Explore announcements, events, messages, etc.
