## Breaking Changes

⚠️ None - This is a new feature that enhances existing dashboards

## Migration Required

❌ No database migrations needed
✅ Uses existing database schema

## Configuration Changes

❌ No .env changes required
❌ No config file changes

## Dependencies Added

❌ No new dependencies

## Testing Required

- [ ] Test all 4 dashboards with appropriate user roles
- [ ] Verify API responses match expected format
- [ ] Test error handling (network errors, unauthorized access)
- [ ] Verify statistics accuracy against database
- [ ] Test on different browsers
- [ ] Test responsive design

## Deployment Steps

1. **Backend:**
   ```bash
   cd church-system
   git pull
   composer install  # if needed
   php artisan config:clear
   php artisan route:clear
   php artisan cache:clear
   ```

2. **Frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   git pull
   npm install  # if needed
   quasar build  # for production
   ```

3. **Verify:**
   - Check all 4 dashboard endpoints return data
   - Login as different roles and test each dashboard
   - Monitor Laravel logs for any errors

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

1. **Backend Rollback:**
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   php artisan route:clear
   ```

2. **Frontend Rollback:**
   - The changes are backward compatible
   - Can revert to previous API calls if needed

## Next Steps / Future Enhancements

1. Add caching layer for dashboard statistics (Redis)
2. Implement real-time updates with WebSockets
3. Add visual charts using Chart.js
4. Allow custom date range filters
5. Add export functionality for reports
6. Create customizable dashboard widgets
7. Add performance monitoring

## Notes

- All dashboards now make a single optimized API call
- Statistics are calculated on the backend for consistency
- Error handling includes user-friendly notifications
- Code is well-documented and follows best practices
